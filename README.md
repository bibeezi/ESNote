# ESNote - An Effective Study Notebook Web Application

## Origination of Idea
While using other note taking apps, I noticed that it was quite difficult to get used to the application.
I thought to create a simpler application for students to take notes with their laptops and phones without having to buy iPads, tablets or physical notebooks.

Essentially, the user will have a notebook page on the screen, they can choose which line to type in with their keypads and type their notes.
The pages can be customized:
* the page width
* line amount
* colours
* includes a margin or not

I also want users to be able to take pictures of a notebook pages that they like so that they can use it on the web app.
The users will be able to use their phone to draw on the web app live to allow people without touchscreen laptops to draw on their notebook.

The pages can also be bundled up to create a notebook of the user's choice.

## Summary of Application
The area of study is in effective note taking techniques, and in web applications.

The problem being tackled is the unnecessary complexity of modern notebook applications, and the inefficient and costly use of expensive devices to write notes instead of a laptop and phone.

To do this, the notebook web application will be simpler, will allow the user to control the look of their notebooks, and use their everyday devices to create notes that help
them study effectively.

I will implement a solution by using a web application for users to use their mobile phones to draw live on the notebook page, and use their laptops to type notes faster than writing.
I will also implement notebook pages that can be used by users and are designed using effective note taking techniques such as Cornell and Mapping.

The application will be evaluated through use over time, with testing made by close friends and myself included. 
The tests will include study effectiveness, ease of use, desire to buy other devices and better work flow.
