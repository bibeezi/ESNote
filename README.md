# ESNote - An Effective Study Notebook Web Application

## Origination of ESNote
While using other note taking apps, I noticed that it was quite difficult to get used to the application as there was a lot of task management features that I was also concentrating on.
I thought to create a simpler application for students to take notes with their laptops and phones without having to buy iPads, digital pens, tablets or physical notebooks.

Essentially, the user will have a note on the screen that they can customize with their own template, and be able to type their notes into each section of their liking.

The notes can also be bundled up to a notebook of the user's choice. A notebook can be designed by colour, a bookmark and a strap.

## Summary of Application
The area of study is in effective note taking techniques, and in web applications.

The problem being tackled is the unnecessary complexity of modern notebook applications, and the inefficient and costly use of expensive devices to write notes instead of a laptop and phone.

To do this, the notebook web application will be simpler, will allow the user to control the look of their notebooks, and use their everyday devices to create notes that help them study effectively.

I will implement a solution by using a web application for users to use their mobile phones to review their notes on the go, and their laptops to type notes faster than writing.

The application will be evaluated through User Interface and User eXperience, the 10 Nielsen's Heuristics, and Responsiveness to Device with testing made by other students and web developers across the world.

## Running the Application
To run the application using the command line, type "npm run dev", then open a browser and enter "http://localhost:3000/" in the URL to open the local version.

Otherwise, type "https://esnote-application.herokuapp.com/" in a browser to open the deployed version on Heroku.

Both versions are the latest working system.

All of the code is written by the Bianca Claudette Palileo.
